### Hi, I'm Dila.

A law graduate exploring how AI can reshape justice.

I believe law should move at the speed of innovation. My mission is to explore how software and AI can create a more accessible, efficient, and fair justice system and to build LegalTech tools that reflect that belief.

This GitHub is my public learning space — where I document my journey from zero coding knowledge to real, working products. Every repository here is a step — sometimes small, sometimes experimental — but always forward.

**Currently exploring:**
- Python fundamentals & AI concepts
- How machine learning can be applied to contracts, disputes, and compliance
- Ethical, responsible and human-centric AI for justice

**Long-term vision:**
Build tools that allow people to understand rights, solve legal problems, and access justice — without barriers.
